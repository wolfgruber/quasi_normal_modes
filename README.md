The programmes in this repository where created in the course of a bachelor
thesis with the title "Scattering of scalar waves on a Schwarzschild black
hole."

The python code simulates such a black hole and its reaction to scalar
radiation. In the file "first_approach.py" the black hole is described with
Eddington Finkelstein coordinates. In the file "cmc_foliation.py" a conatant
mean curvature foliation is used. The file "plt_fit.py" delivers functions to
load, analyse and plot the obtained data.

The code is neither optimizes nor documented and only lightly commented, but
it is sufficient for the task it was designed to do.
